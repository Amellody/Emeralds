				<p>The Sydney Emeralds Synchronized Swimming Club was created in October 2007 by Myriam Glez and Katarina Hall.</p>
				
				<p>When Myriam and Katarina moved to Sydney, they were both looking to train and coach for a synchronized swimming club. However, as they discovered that there were no active clubs in Sydney, they decided to establish the Sydney Emeralds Synchronized Swimming Club. Originally starting only with 5 registered members, the Sydney Emeralds is currently the largest synchronized swimming club in New South Wales. Training sessions are held at various locations in Sydney.</p>

					<p>At the end of 2010, the Club sadly farewelled one of the club’s founders Myriam Glez who moved with her family to Great Britain. However, the Club was strengthened by an increasing input of its members (competitors and their parents) and a dedicated team of coaches. The Sydney Emeralds coaching team consists of Katarina Hall, Amanda Reid, Erika Bockler, and an increasing number of temporary international coaches. In 2011, the Club welcomed visiting coaches Emilie Denechere and Celine Nicole, both from France and currently the club is hosting Stacy Semikilit from Moscow, Russia. The club is also growing their own young enthusiastic coaches Liching Yew and Amie Thompson.</p>

					<p>The Sydney Emeralds’ objective is to develop synchronized swimming at every level from beginners to elite athletes, and at every age, from 4 years old to Masters Swimmers. We strive to provide our swimmers with the opportunity to achieve their personal best as individuals, athletes and team members in a club environment which values respect, dedication and sportsmanship. The Sydney Emeralds Coaching Team is very experienced having competed and coached at the highest level. The Sydney Emeralds Synchronized Swimming Club is a non-profit organisation and is incorporated with the NSW Fair Trading Office.</p>
